VASL v5.1 adds keyboard commands to Move selected units.
NumLock must be ON for both notebook and full-size keyboards.
Hold down the ctrl-key in combination w/ the selected numpad direction key.

	ctrl-num8 - dir 1
	ctrl-num9 - dir 2
	ctrl-num3 - dir 3
	ctrl-num2 - dir 4
	ctrl-num1 - dir 5
	ctrl-num7 - dir 6

This layout corresponds (roughly) to the standard ASL direction-description
as diagrammed on a Sniper or OBA ctr, w/ 'dir 1' corresponding to 'up'.
This orientation stays constant regardless of a ctr's CA / VCA.

All National O/B units [EXC: Acq, Ctrl, Sniper, OBA] and many 1/2" & 5/8" Info
markers have Move capability. Location, Fortification, Destruction & certain
other markers (SMOKE, Residual FP, Abandoned) do not have ctrl-cmd Movement.
All Moved units will Report in the chat dialog. Overlays will not Move.

Multiple ctrs/stacks can be selected using shift-click or click&drag.
Individual ctrs can be selected from an expanded stack using shift-click.
Only the selected ctrs that 'own' the Move-cmds will respond.

Stack Movement:
Click on the top-most unit of a collapsed stack to highlight it, a ctrl-cmd
Move will affect the entire stack. Location markers (such as Fortifications
or Terrain) will not Move with the stack. If the top-most ctr does not
have Move capability (such as TI or Immobilized markers), the stack will
NOT Move, but if such ctrs are included elsewhere in the stack, they will
Move along w/ the stack.
