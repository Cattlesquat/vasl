--Checking LOS

About LOS Checking
------------------
VASL provides an integrated tool you can use to check line of sight (LOS).

Version 6 and later boards support LOS checking. Check the release notes for a list of boards supported in the
version. For HASL boards, only Red Barricades currently supports LOS Checking. For third party products,
only BFP boards currently support LOS checking.

You can flip and crop boards, but if you are using VASL versions prior to 6.4.0, boards must be cropped to
half-hexes for LOS checking to work. From versions 6.4.0 forward, LOS checking should work in any map configuration.

LOS checking can apply ETO terrain rules or PTO terrain rules. DTO terrain rules do not apply. ETO terrain
transformations available in the board picker apply with the following exceptions
• Orchard to Crag
• Orchard to Shellholes
• Shellholes to Crag
• Shellholes to Orchard

PTO terrain rules are applied when you choose and apply the PTO Transformations option in the Terrain
Transformations dialog. The following transformations are available:
• Dense Jungle
• Bamboo
• Palm Trees
• Swamp

The following transformation is not available:
• Wooden building to huts

If the Dense Jungle box is not checked when other boxes in the PTO Transformations are checked, woods are treated
as Light Jungle.

LOS checking does not apply to overlays, but does apply to certain counters. LOS checking also does not detect
hindrances along a Continuous Slope. LOS checking does not work correctly in board edge half-hexes where abutting
half-hexes have different terrain types.

The LOS engine does not enforce the rule that terrain must be visible on both sides of the thread to affect LOS. If the
thread touches an obstacle or hindrance, LOS will be affected.

Checking Line of sight (LOS)
----------------------------
To check LOS:
1. Click an LOS button.
All counters on the board are hidden. Hindrances from various counters are included in the LOS check even if
the counters are hidden: SMOKE (including smoke from blazes and burning wrecks), Rubble,
OBA FFE, and vehicles and wrecks.

2. Click on the center dot or a vertex of one of the hexes for which you want to check LOS.
This hex is considered the source or origin hex of the LOS.

3. Drag your mouse cursor to the other hex for which you want to check LOS.
This hex is considered the target hex for the LOS check.
The thread snaps to the either the center dot of the hex, or to the nearest hex vertex.

4. LOS is checked at the lowest level of the hex by default. If the source (origin) or target hex have additional levels,
you can move the LOS thread to those levels using the following key combinations:

Keystroke 		Moves...
---------		--------
Up arrow 		the target location up.
Down arrow 		the target location down.
Ctrl+up arrow 		source location up.
Ctrl+down arrow 	source location up

The LOS thread indicates the state of the line of sight
• Black: LOS is clear.
• Red: LOS is hindered.
• Blue: LOS is blocked.

A popup states the range between the source (origin) and target hexes.

LOS checking configuration
--------------------------
Several configurations options are available for configuring LOS checking.

LOS configuration options are available on the LOS tab of the Preferences dialog (File > Preferences.

The following configuration options are available:
• Changing thread color

The default thread colors are:
• Clear: black
• Hindered: red
• Blocked: blue

You can change the thread color for each condition. Click the button for the condition for which you want to
change the color. VASL displays a color picker. Pick the new color you want to use for the condition.

• Counter LOS hindrances
By default, all counters are removed from the board when you click a LOS button. Check the Retain LOShindrance
counters box to retain counters that affect LOS on board when checking LOS. Counters that affect
LOS include
• SMOKE counters, including Smoke Grenades
• blazes
• OBA counters
• Vehicles, wrecks, and burning wrecks
• rubble counters

• Snap to grid
By default, the thread snaps to the nearest hex center dot or hex vertex. Check the Snap Thread to grid? box
to disable this behavior. When you uncheck this box, the thread stays at the drag point, and does not snap to the
nearest center dot or hex vertex.

• Enable and disable LOS checking behavior
Checking this box enables LOS checking behavior. When this box is unchecked, you can still click the LOS
buttons to draw LOS, but the color of the thread does not change to indicate condition of the LOS, and range and
other information is not reported in the VASL interface.

• Verbose LOS checking
By default, LOS checking only reports the range and displays different threat colors depending on whether LOS is
clear, hindered, or blocked. When you check the Verbose LOS mode box, LOS checking also reports:
• hex coordinates of the source hex and the target hex
• level of the source hex and target hex for which LOS is being checked
• range from the source hex to the target hex
• number of hindrances, if any
• reason for LOS being blocked
