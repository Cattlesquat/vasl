This function highlights counters & markers that require attention during
the Rally Phase. Only counters dragged to the map from VASL v5.5 (or later) tray
will be included - counters created in previous versions of VASL will not show in the list.

Procedure:
After you load a game, a button representing a Malf Gun will appear in the
'VASL controls' toolbar. Click the button and all broken infantry units, SW, AFV and Guns
will be highlighted by a red circle.

To remove the highlighting, click the button again.

During your Rally Phase, you can make changes to the counters, flipping or
deleting them as appropriate, while the highlighting is in place. Simply
click the button again when finished to remove the highlighting before
continuing to the next phase.

Only these counters will be highlighted:
	All Broken MMC & SMC counters
	All malfed SW counters
	All Malfed Dismantleable Guns (in both their 1/2" & 5/8" states)
	All Malfed Guns (v5.9 and later, only)
	DM & Disrupt markers
	MG & Gun Malf markers (but not their Disabled flips)
	Vehicle MA / SA / MG Malf markers (but not their Disabled flips)
	Shock / UK markers (both sides)
	stun & STUN markers (but not their +1 / Recall flips)

Your oppo will not see any of your HIPped counters with this highlighting,
but will see a '? counter' (say, a malfed SW that was moved out of LOS
in the APh and was able to gain Concealment in the CCPh). Players may wish
to adopt the technique of HIPping any Concealed malfed SW, and adding a
generic ?-counter to the stack.

Only counters created from base VASL v5.5 (or later) will be displayed.
Only Guns from base VASL v5.9 (or later) will be displayed.
Counters from earlier versions of VASL will not be included.
Counters from Extensions (especially those created prior to v5.5) may
not show.
