<!-- 
    Board-level metadata
	name - the name of the board (as it will appear in board selector drop-down - not yet supported)
	version - the board version
	versionDate - the date the last version was created
	author - the caring soul who created the board
    boardImage - the name of the VASL image file in the board archive; the name is case sensitive
    hasHills - TRUE/FALSE if the board contains base elevations above ground level
                if not we can assume the ground level under the terrain is zero, which
                makes the VASL LOS image translation faster and more accurate
    height - height of the board in hexes. Standard geomorphic boards are 10 by 33 hexes
	hexHeight - the height of a hex in pixels - decimal - should be image/height
	hexWidth - the width of a hex in pixels - decimal - center point to center point
	A1CenterX - x location of the A1 center dot
	A1CenterY - y location of the A1 center dot

        The type of buildings on the map. Because the building colors are shared by all building types, VASL can't easily
        determine the proper building type when creating the LOS information and assumes buildings are single-hex stone or 
        wooden buildings. Use these elements to override the building type.
