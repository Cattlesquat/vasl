<!-- 
    Board-level metadata
	name - the name of the board (as it will appear in board selector drop-down - not yet supported)
	version - the board version
	versionDate - the date the last version was created
	author - the caring soul who created the board
    boardImage - the name of the VASL image file in the board archive; the name is case sensitive
    hasHills - TRUE/FALSE if the board contains base elevations above ground level
                if not we can assume the ground level under the terrain is zero, which
                makes the VASL LOS image translation faster and more accurate
    height - height of the board in hexes. Standard geomorphic boards are 10 by 33 hexes
    width - width of the board in hexes.
	others - TBD e.g. alternate hex grain, etc.
